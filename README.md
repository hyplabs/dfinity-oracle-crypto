# Dfinity Crypto Oracle Example

[Dfinity Oracles](https://github.com/hyplabs/dfinity-oracles) is a framework for building [blockchain oracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_oracle) for the [Internet Computer](https://dfinity.org/).

Dfinity Crypto Oracle Example is a sample project using Dfinity Oracles to retrieve the current ETH and BTC prices from a number of different cryptocurrency exchanges, summarize them, and write the results to a software canister.

[Dfinity Weather Oracle Example](https://github.com/hyplabs/dfinity-oracles) is another sample project, using Dfinity Oracles to retrieve current weather conditions in various cities.

Also see the [Dfinity Oracles tutorial](https://github.com/hyplabs/dfinity-oracles/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md) for step-by-step instructions about writing oracles from scratch.
